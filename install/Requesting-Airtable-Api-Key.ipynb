    "# Requesting an Airtable API Key \n",
    "\n",
    "This course will involve projects that require you to make API requests to retrieve data from remote data sources. We have chosen to use the flexible database/spreadsheet hybrid [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) as our primary remote data store.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to interface with Airtable from Python, you will need to create an Airtable account and provide us with an API key so we can authorize your access to necessary tables. \n",
