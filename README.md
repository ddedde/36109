# Course Goals

MODELING
- Discrete event simulation (the core modeling class only does Monte Carlo)
- Network/Graphical models,  such as:
  - TSP
  - Assignment/Matchings,  such as Uber driver to customers, and/or GrubHub drivers to orders
  - Clustering,  such as Uber pool,  or multiple Grubhub orders per driver
- Sensitivity analysis:  What happens if some parameters change a bit?

 These ideas could be combined in lots of ways, for example, your TSP customers may have demands, one can simulate inventory required and truck capacity needed.   One might cluster customers to form routes for each of multiple trucks.   The possibilities are vast, and many more than we will have time for.

PROGRAMMING, besides python basics:
 - Visualization ... plots, Google Maps, ...
 - Web scrapping
 - APIs
 - Persistant data:  SQL
 
Obviously there is still lots of work to go to figure out how to organize the above into a coherent course!
